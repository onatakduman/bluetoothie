While I was preparing Bluetoothie, I was inspired by [douglasjunior/AndroidBluetoothLibrary](https://github.com/douglasjunior/AndroidBluetoothLibrary). It likely similar in most cases, 
I jus change some data reading buffer. It looks like Kotlin version of [this](https://github.com/douglasjunior/AndroidBluetoothLibrary) library.
1. [douglasjunior/AndroidBluetoothLibrary](https://github.com/douglasjunior/AndroidBluetoothLibrary) 's data read function is buffers 1024 bytes and does not triger read function until its full.
2. [glodanif/BluetoothChat](https://github.com/glodanif/BluetoothChat) I inspired file transfer progress method.
